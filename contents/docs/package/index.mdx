For the steps required, you only need to create a package file, namely `package.json` to store libraries or other modules such as jkt48connect, and this is an example:.
```json:package.json showLineNumbers {1-15}
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Project dengan @jkt48connect/cli",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@jkt48connect-corp/sdk": "3.0.14"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=14.0.0"
  }
}
```

if you don't want to use package.json you can use this alternative:
# NPX
```sh
npx @jkt48connect-corp/sdk
```
# NPM
```sh
npm install @jkt48connect-corp/sdk
```
