description: A complete guide on retrieving live streaming data from IDN using JKT48Connect API.
---

## Introduction
The `getIdn` feature in the JKT48Connect API allows developers to fetch live streaming data conducted by JKT48 members on the IDN platform. This feature is useful for applications that need real-time information on ongoing live streams.

Developers can use this feature to:  
- Display a list of ongoing IDN live streams in their applications.  
- Retrieve detailed information about each live stream, including member details, images, start and end times, and streaming URLs.  
- Monitor live streaming trends of JKT48 members on the IDN platform for analytics and reporting purposes.  

<Note type="note" title="Important Note">
This feature **requires a premium API key**. You can obtain an API key by visiting the [JKT48Connect dashboard](https://dash.jkt48connect.my.id). To purchase a premium API key, complete the transaction through the dashboard.

## How to Use `getIdn`
Below is an example of how to retrieve IDN live streaming data using **Node.js**:

```javascript:example.js showLineNumbers {1-15}
const { getIdn } = require("@jkt48connect/cli");

// Enter your API key here
const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"; // Replace with a valid API key

async function fetchIdnLiveData() {
    try {
        // Calling getIdn function to fetch live IDN data
        const liveData = await getIdn(apiKey);
        
        // Displaying the result in the console
        console.log("IDN Live Streaming Data:", liveData);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Failed to retrieve IDN live data:", error.message);
    }
}

// Executing the function to get IDN live data
fetchIdnLiveData();
```

## Data Structure
When the `getIdn` function is called, the API returns a list of ongoing IDN live streams. The response data typically includes the following fields:

- **`member`**: Information about the JKT48 member conducting the live stream, including:
  - `name` → Full name of the member.
  - `nickname` → Member’s nickname.
  - `img` → URL of the live stream cover image.
  - `img_alt` → URL of the member's profile image.
  - `url` → Unique ID of the member in the JKT48Connect system.
  - `is_graduate` → Indicates whether the member has graduated.
  - `is_official` → Indicates whether the live stream is an official JKT48 broadcast or an individual stream.

- **`live_info`**: Information related to the live stream, including:
  - `duration` → Live stream duration in milliseconds.
  - `viewers.num` → Number of viewers watching the live stream.
  - `viewers.is_excitement` → Indicates whether the live stream is highly interactive.
  - `date.start` → Start time of the live stream in UTC format.
  - `date.end` → End time of the live stream in UTC format.

- **`idn`**: Specific data related to IDN live streaming, including:
  - `id` → Unique ID of the live stream on the IDN platform.
  - `username` → IDN username of the member conducting the live stream.
  - `slug` → Unique identifier for the live stream.
  - `title` → Title of the live stream.
